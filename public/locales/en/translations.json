    "acerca_nosotros": "<div class=\"acerca_nosotros_div\"><div><h1>About Us</h1><p><strong>TradesHabbo</strong> is a fansite created by <strong>emo.</strong>, a veteran player who started his Habbo journey in mid-2006. After several years playing with different characters, he finally adopted the name <strong>emo.</strong> in Habbo Legacy and later joined Origins from day one of its opening.</p></div><div><p><strong>emo.'s</strong> real name is <strong>Camilo Yaya</strong>, a software engineer at MercadoLibre. From the early days of playing on Habbo Origins, he noticed a problem: the difficulty in knowing item prices, identifying what was available, and analyzing whether prices were going up or down. For this reason, he created the first Habbo Origins ES catalog, called <strong>Nexus | Mercado Origins</strong>, under the domain <em>trades-habbo-origins.online</em>. The first version was very simple: it only showed some images and prices without any interaction. Its initial goal was to be a basic price catalog, with only 43 furnis listed. This version was launched on <strong>June 20, 2024</strong>, just two days after the opening of Origins.</p><div class=\"centrar_imagen\"><img src=\"./furnis/acerca_nosotros/nexus_mercado_origins.gif\" alt=\"Nexus Mercado Origins\"></div></div><div><p>From the beginning, we faced criticism and opposition. Some people rejected our existence because our transparency prevented them from manipulating other users with misinformation or scams. This led to multiple attacks, such as <strong>SQL injections</strong> and <strong>denial-of-service (DDoS)</strong>.</p><p>However, during this process, significant conflicts arose within the community. The first controversy occurred over the price modification of the \"sofa throne,\" which sparked a public discussion with the user <strong>\"Conectando\"</strong>. Shortly after, another controversy related to the prices of first-generation Funky Plasto items ignited a debate with the user <strong>\"Neutralizado\"</strong>. These tensions divided the community into two sides: those who supported our catalog and those who rejected it. As a result, we were expelled from the unofficial Discord of the Habbo Origins ES community. In response, we created our own Discord server, consolidating our community on <strong>July 1, 2024</strong>.</p></div><div><p>Despite these challenges, the development of the page continued. By <strong>July 3, 2024</strong>, we launched a more visually friendly version with new features such as the price history of furnis and the ability to vote if a price seemed fair. We were also the first to integrate <strong>Trax</strong> music on a website for playback, showcasing our love for the game. Additionally, we created a design inspired by the \"Habbo Console\" to display news and a trade calculator, allowing users to compare the values of different furnis. At this point, we also implemented advanced protections against cyberattacks.</p><div class=\"centrar_imagen\"><img src=\"./furnis/acerca_nosotros/tradeshabbov2.gif\" alt=\"TradesHabbo Origins\"></div></div><div><p>On <strong>August 31, 2024</strong>, thanks to the success of the page and the growth of our Discord community, we officially became a fansite. We introduced new categories like <strong>Master Trades</strong>, where users could debate and vote on prices. We also developed a system to rank <strong>Master Traders</strong> into levels (bronze, silver, and gold) based on influence, capital, experience, and hours played. Initially, we had 18 standout Master Traders:</p><ul><li>Evolucion</li><li>SD</li><li>Respeto</li><li>C@rlos</li><li>Jack</li><li>XL</li><li>Wazaby</li><li>Emo.</li><li>Lynz</li><li>IJN</li><li>.Jade.</li><li>8Enigma8</li><li>HighClass</li><li>YooCo</li><li>Mariecito</li><li>IVendettaX</li><li>DiegoCop</li><li>Yaza</li></ul><p>Additionally, we created the first integrated bot for the Habbo Origins ES community, automating voting polls, generating news automatically, and publishing them on Discord and Twitter.</p></div><div class=\"centrar_imagen\"><img src=\"./furnis/acerca_nosotros/imagen-mastertraders.png\" alt=\"TradesHabbo Master Traders\" class=\"image_width_100\"></div><div><h2>Mobile Adaptation</h2><p>At the same time, we worked on the mobile version of the website, optimizing it for mobile devices. We implemented a design inspired by the \"Habbo Console,\" ensuring a smooth and accessible experience for users accessing from their phones. This version remains a key pillar of our platform.</p><div class=\"centrar_imagen\"><img src=\"./furnis/acerca_nosotros/tradeshabbo_mobile_view.png\" alt=\"TradesHabbo Master Mobile View\"></div></div><div><p>Although we faced challenges, such as the dissolution of the Master Traders category in September 2024 due to the disinterest of some members, we have remained committed. An important pillar on this journey has been <strong>Nautik</strong>, who joined our community and has been a great support since then. 😊</p></div><div><p>In October 2024, we became the first Habbo Origins fansite to adopt seasonal themes according to the hotel's seasons, something common in Habbo Legacy fansites but unprecedented in Origins. We also began translating the website into multiple languages. Initially, we offered nine languages, but we now focus on Spanish, English, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p><div class=\"centrar_imagen\"><img src=\"./furnis/acerca_nosotros/tradeshabbo_octubre_2024.png\" alt=\"TradesHabbo Master October View\" class=\"image_width_100\"></div><p>Today, TradesHabbo stands strong thanks to the joint efforts of our team and the constant support of our community. We are not here for economic interests or manipulation, as some have claimed, but for the love of Habbo and its community. We want to show that with dedication and passion, it is possible to maintain a transparent, useful, and fun space for all players.</p><p><strong>Thank you to everyone who has supported this project and to those who, with their criticisms, have pushed us to improve. Without the good and the bad, we wouldn't be here today for you.</strong></p></div></div>",

    "preguntas_respuestas": "<div class=\"faq_section\"><div><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1></div><div><h2>Are you an official Habbo fansite?</h2><p>Currently, we are not an official fansite. However, we aspire to achieve this recognition in the future.</p></div><div><h2>Are you just a price catalog?</h2><p>No, we are much more than a price catalog. We also operate as a fansite, playing key roles such as delivering news, events, updates, and other relevant content for the community. Although our primary focus is the price catalog, we strive to offer varied and useful content.</p></div><div><h2>Are you only present in the Spanish hotel?</h2><p>No, we are present in the Spanish hotel (.es) and the English hotel (.com). Additionally, we have established connections with the Brazilian hotel community (.br). In the Brazilian community, we have opted to maintain strategic partnerships and translate our website into Portuguese rather than directly participating in the game.</p></div><div><h2>How do you determine the catalog prices?</h2><p>We have a team responsible for adjusting catalog prices based on their expertise and successful trades carried out by us or community members. While we do our best to maintain accuracy, occasional errors or outdated prices may occur. This is never intentional or for the purpose of price manipulation. If in doubt, we recommend checking the price history.</p></div><div><h2>Do you collect personal information from website visitors?</h2><p>No, we do not collect any personal information from website visitors. The only information that might be stored is related to registered users. Currently, the registration system is primarily designed for internal use by TradesHabbo members. Although any user can register, logging in does not grant additional privileges. If this policy changes in the future, we will announce it through our official channels (Discord, Twitter) and publish a statement on our website.</p></div><div><h2>Do you manipulate catalog prices for your benefit?</h2><p>No. Our goal is to provide transparent and updated information to the community. We do not collect large quantities of a rare item or alter prices for convenience, as some might claim. Price adjustments are made based on the market at the time of modification, always with an impartial and professional approach.</p></div><div><h2>Do you host giveaways and events?</h2><p>Primarily, we organize giveaways because they are easy to participate in and allow greater interaction with the community. Currently, we do not host events due to low participation in such activities. However, we have the capacity to organize events, as demonstrated in the past with the \"Habboolympics.\" For now, we have chosen to establish strategic partnerships with community event organizers, collaborating and supporting their initiatives.</p></div></div>",
